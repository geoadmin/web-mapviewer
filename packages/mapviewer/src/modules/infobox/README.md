# Infobox module

Adds a container that holds any dynamic information about the map / feature that the user could need (drawing style edition, feature identification, etc...)

Depending on the viewport size (or user's preference/config) this container will be (for desktop mode) a side tray that can be collapsed at will,
and for mobile mode a swipeable element that takes place at the bottom of the screen.

## Swipable element

This element will by default show a small version of the content, with only its title.
At the top of this swipe element is a grabbing part that can be either touched, or swiped, and can open up the whole element (and then show the feature/element whole information)
