# Testing

## Unit testing

This projected uses [@vue/cli-plugin-unit-mocha](https://cli.vuejs.org/core-plugins/unit-mocha.html) (it is preferred to use Mocha instead of Jest, because Cypress also uses mocha, the syntax will then be consistent throughout the project). All things related to unit testing are in the folder `/tests/unit/`.

To run unit tests, execute `npm run test:unit`.

## E2E testing

This project uses [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E tests. All things related to tests are in the folder `/tests/e2e/`.

There are two ways of executing E2E tests, either with a UI feedback using `npm run test:e2e` (which will open the Cypress GUI, you can then choose which test to run), or by running all E2E test headless with `npm run test:headless`.

### Using cypress on a Windows machine

To use Cypress on Windows, it is required to go through the Windows Linux Subsystem (WLS) and more specifically WSL2 (here's [Microsoft's install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10))

In order to see Cypress' window, we will need an XServer client running on Windows that can show Linux's window. Here's a [guide that tells you exactly how to do that](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/gui-on-wsl2-cypress).

- [a Microsoft guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/running-wsl-gui-apps-on-windows-10/ba-p/1493242) on how to show Linux's windows in Win10.
- [a markdown file on Github](https://github.com/QMonkey/wsl-tutorial/blob/master/README.wsl2.md) explaining the same thing.

#### Source code in WSL2 file system

Be mindful that if you want to develop locally (through `npm run serve`) and also do E2E testing locally, you should host your code directly on the WSL2 file system. Otherwise `npm run serve` will not detect code changes (through WSL2 and Win file system) and your dev experience will be really degraded (having to restart `npm run serve` after each change made to the code).

It is possible to use VSCode like [this one](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) or if using another IDE, you could simply mount your WSL2 file system as a Drive (and then access your code through `Z:\...`)

### Using cypress on a Unix machine

Follow the [Cypress install guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements)

### Folder structure

We leverage the [Vue E2E Cypress integration](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/@vue/cli-plugin-e2e-cypress#readme), so Vue is managing most of what Cypress needs.
Specs (test files) are located in `/tests/e2e/specs/` and it is possible to write some commands (helper function) in `/tests/e2e/support/commands.js`.

## CI

The CI will run both test types by executing `npm run test:ci` (E2E tests will be run headless)
