 * [LV03/EPSG:21781]{@link https://epsg.io/21781}) and metric Web Mercator
 * ([EPSG:3857]{@link https://epsg.io/3857}) definitions to proj4
 *
 * Further projection can be added by settings the param projections (do not forget to include LV95, LV03 and/or WebMercator if you intended to use them too)
