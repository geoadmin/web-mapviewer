/**
 * Will enable the user to edit selected features by drag and dropping part of it on the map. Will
 * also enable point deletion with a right click.
 *
 * This component needs to have access to the selected features from the select interaction (it gets
 * them through a provide/inject coupling)
 *
 * It will emit those events :
 *
 * - `featureIsDragged`: whenever a feature has been dragged and is being moved by the user over the map
 * - `featureIsDropped`: when the dragged feature is released, will give both the feature and the
 *   coordinates of the drop location in args (as an object `{ feature: {}, coordinates: [] }`)
 *
 *   - `modifyEnd`: when an edit has finished (not necessarily a drag and drop, can also be a point deletion)
