/**
 * Vue mixin that will handle the addition or removal of a drawing interaction to the drawing module.
 *
 * This interaction will be responsible for one of the many shape available to draw. It will handle
 * the start and ending of the drawing (later edition will be handled elsewhere)
 *
 * Each component using this mixin must define some data (or methods) :
 *
 * - `extraProperties`: either an object or a function (with no args) returning an object. This
 *   defines some props that will be set in each feature's metadata created by this interaction
 *   (i.e. the fill color used, which size the text should be, etc...)
 * - `drawingMode`: which drawing mode (from {@link DrawingModes}) is being used with this interaction
 * - `geometryType`: which geometry type (from OL {@link GeometryType}) is being drawn on the map by
 *   this interaction
 *
 * It is also possible to define optionals :
 *
 * - `onDrawStart` (function): called after the drawing has started with the feature being drawn as argument
 * - `onDrawEnd` (function): called after the drawing is done with the drawn feature as argument
 * - `editingStyle` (function): style function used while drawing, if none given
 *   {@link editingFeatureStyleFunction} will be used
 * - `featureStyle` (function): style applied to the feature as soon as it is done being drawn, will
 *   use {@link featureStyleFunction} if none is given
