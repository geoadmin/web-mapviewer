/**
 * Metadata for an external WMTS layer, that will be defined through a GetCapabilities.xml endpoint
 * (and a layer ID)
 *
 * @WARNING DON'T USE GETTER AND SETTER ! Instances of this class will be used a Vue 3 reactive
 * object which SHOULD BE plain javascript object ! For convenience we use class instances but this
 * has some limitations and javascript class getter and setter are not correctly supported which
 * introduced subtle bugs. As rule of thumb we should avoid any public methods with side effects on
 * properties, properties should change be changed either by the constructor or directly by setting
 * them, not through a functions that updates other properties as it can lead to subtle bugs due
 * to Vue reactivity engine.
