/**
 * Description of a group of layers, that could be added altogether or separately, that stems from a
 * getCapabilities XML parsing. (see
 * https://www.mediamaps.ch/ogc/schemas-xsdoc/sld/1.2/capabilities_1_3_0_xsd.html#Layer)
 *
 * If the group of layer is added to the map, all layers being part of it should be added under this
 * group's name "banner"
 *
 * @WARNING DON'T USE GETTER AND SETTER ! Instances of this class will be used a Vue 3 reactive
 * object which SHOULD BE plain javascript object ! For convenience we use class instances but this
 * has some limitations and javascript class getter and setter are not correctly supported which
 * introduced subtle bugs. As rule of thumb we should avoid any public methods with side effects on
 * properties, properties should change be changed either by the constructor or directly by setting
 * them, not through a functions that updates other properties as it can lead to subtle bugs due
 * to Vue reactivity engine.
