/**
 * Description of a group of layers, or category of layers, in the context of the catalogue. This
 * group can't be added directly on the map, only its layer children can.
 *
 * This is used to describe categories in the topic navigation / representation.
 *
 * @WARNING DON'T USE GETTER AND SETTER ! Instances of this class will be used a Vue 3 reactive
 * object which SHOULD BE plain javascript object ! For convenience we use class instances but this
 * has some limitations and javascript class getter and setter are not correctly supported which
 * introduced subtle bugs. As rule of thumb we should avoid any public methods with side effects on
 * properties, properties should change be changed either by the constructor or directly by setting
 * them, not through a functions that updates other properties as it can lead to subtle bugs due
 * to Vue reactivity engine.
